`faissR` benchmarks should separate vector-search quality from downstream
embedding or clustering quality.

## Recommended Measurements

For every KNN method record:

- dataset name, `n`, `p`, metric, and `k`;
- backend requested and backend used;
- build time, query time, and total time;
- peak RAM and GPU memory where measurable;
- recall@k against an exact reference on a reproducible subset;
- mean distance error and neighbour-rank agreement;
- downstream sanity checks such as openTSNE/UMAP plots when KNN is used for
  embeddings.

## Fair CPU And CUDA Runs

Use fixed CPU thread counts when comparing CPU algorithms:

```r
Sys.setenv(
  OMP_NUM_THREADS = "4",
  OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS = "4",
  MKL_NUM_THREADS = "4"
)
```

For CUDA benchmarks, report the GPU model, driver, CUDA version, FAISS build,
and cuVS version. Explicit CUDA failures should be recorded as failures, not
silently replaced with CPU timings.

## Reuse KNN

Large benchmarks should save KNN output once:

```r
knn <- nn(x, k = 100, backend = "auto", metric = "euclidean", n_threads = 4)
saveRDS(knn, "knn_k100.rds")
```

The same object can then feed `fastEmbedR`, graph construction, classifier
tests, and recall diagnostics without paying the KNN cost repeatedly.

## HPC Note

When running many datasets and backends on a shared HPC, submit CPU and GPU
jobs separately and throttle job arrays. One failed method should write a
failure row and continue with the next method/dataset.
